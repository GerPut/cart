## Shopping Cart

This basic React app is a shopping cart that is used to add and remove items with their prices to a list. Items can be added with + and removed with - or removed completely from within the list. The prices of the items gets added and a total ammount gets displayed at the bottom. I learned how to import my data that I have setup as a constant. I also learned how to build components, pass props and how to style React components with bootstrap.
